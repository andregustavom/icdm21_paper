# Accurately Quantifying under Score Variability - Supplementary Material
## Experiments performed over real datasets

Running experiments over real datasets requires a previous step for building a couple of items. All these items can be download from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ea9b3jwbmoc3crc/AACYfkTBJHOrjqE99xtkhZIba?dl=0) or you can build it again using the procedure _prepare_dataset_ from the R file "./functions/prepare_dataset.r". In our experiments we used twelve datasets therefore you must type in shell this:

```r
prepare_dataset(1) #for the first dataset and so fort, until:
prepare_dataset(12)
```



> **Note:** Therefore, before running the procedure from the runner_real.r file, please be sure that you have ran it or downloaded the models_train_test folder from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ea9b3jwbmoc3crc/AACYfkTBJHOrjqE99xtkhZIba?dl=0)
